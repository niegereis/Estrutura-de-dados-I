18th century novel
==================

The idea of the "rise of the novel" in the 18th century is especially associated with Ian Watt's important study The Rise of the Novel (1957).[note 6] Ian Watt puts forward the idea that novel was a
"new form" and associates this with the importance placed on realism by novelists such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, and Henry Fielding.[40] This theory about the novel in the 18th century led
to the suggestion that the earlier Romance forms of long prose narrative were either not novels or were at least inferior.[41] However, others including Margaret Anne Doody disagree that the novel
originated in the 18th century, arguing that the history of the novel is over two thousands years old, and that in addition the romance tradition continued through the 18th and 19th centuries and
still flourishes today.[42] The idea of the rise of the novel in the 18th century is especially associated with English literary criticism,[42] and most other European languages use the word "roman"
(Portuguese "romance" and Italian "romans") for an extended narratives.[7] Novelist and critic Albert J. Guerard argues, in The Triumph of the Novel (1976), on behalf of the anti-realist "other great
tradition" of the novel that includes Rabelais, Cervantes, Pynchon, Borges, Garcia Marquez, the "Joyce of Finnegans Wake and the Nabokov of Ada", and sees Ian Watt's The Rise of the Novel as
contributing to a confusion between fiction and "real life", "by its insistence on 'formal realism' as implicit in the novel form in general".[43] Guerard suggests that Watt's book is most useful "for
a study of the eighteenth-century novel", but that it "should not be applied to the genre as a whole".[44]

Given these differences in opinion, what happened in the 18th century can best be described, not as the rise of the novel, but the rise of realism in fiction. Indeed, this is what Ian Watt sees as
distinguishing the novel from earlier prose narratives.[45]

Philosophical novel
-------------------
The new 18th-century status of the novel as an object of debate is manifested in the development of philosophical[note 7] and experimental novels.

Philosophical fiction was not exactly new. Plato's dialogues were embedded in fictional narratives. Utopias had added to this production with works from Thomas More's Utopia (1516) to Tommaso
Campanella's City of the Sun (1602). Works such as these had not been read as novels or romances but as philosophical texts. The 1740s saw new editions of More's work under the title that created the
tradition: Utopia: or the happy republic; a philosophical romance (1743).[citation needed]

Voltaire utilised the romance to write philosophy in Micromegas: a comic romance. Being a severe satire upon the philosophy, ignorance, and self-conceit of mankind (1752, English 1753). His Zadig
(1747) and Candide (1759) became central texts of the French Enlightenment and of the modern novel. Jean-Jacques Rousseau bridged the genres with his less fictional Emile: or, On Education (1762).
[citation needed]

Laurence Sterne's The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (1759–1767) is an experimental work which rejects continuous narration. In it the author not only addresses the reader in his
preface but speaks directly to him or her in his fictional narrative. In addition to his narrative experiments, Sterne has visual experiments, such as a marbled page, a black page to express sorrow,
and a page of lines to show the plot lines of the book. Jonathan Swift's A Tale of a Tub (1704) was an early precursor in this field.[citation needed]

The romance genre in the 18th century
-------------------------------------
The rise of the word novel at the cost of its rival, the romance, remained a Spanish and English phenomenon, and though readers all over Western Europe had welcomed the novel(la) or short history as
an alternative in the second half of the 17th century, only the English and the Spanish had, however, openly discredited the romance.[citation needed]

But the change of taste was brief and Fenelon's Telemachus (1699/1700) already exploited a nostalgia for the old romances with their heroism and professed virtue. Jane Barker explicitly advertised her
Exilius as "A new Romance", "written after the Manner of Telemachus", in 1715.[46] Robinson Crusoe spoke of his own story as a "romance", though in the preface to the third volume, published in 1720,
Defoe attacks all who said "that [...] the Story is feign'd, that the Names are borrow'd, and that it is all a Romance; that there never were any such Man or Place".

The late 18th century brought an answer with the Romantic Movement's readiness to reclaim the word romance, especially with the gothic romance, but the historical novels of Walter Scott also have a
strong romance element.[citation needed] Robinson Crusoe became a "novel" in this period appearing now as a work of the new realistic fiction that the 18th century had created.[citation needed]

Throughout the 19th century, romances continued to be written in Britain by writers like Emily Bronte,[5] and in America by the dark romantic novelists Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Herman Melville.[47]

The sentimental novel
---------------------
Sentimental novels relied on emotional responses, both from their readers and characters. They feature scenes of distress and tenderness, and the plot is arranged to advance emotions rather than
action. The result is a valorization of "fine feeling," displaying the characters as a model for refined, sensitive emotional effect. The ability to display feelings was thought to show character and
experience, and to shape social life and relations.[48]

An example of this genre of fiction is Samuel Richardson's Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (1740), composed "to cultivate the Principles of Virtue and Religion in the Minds of the Youth of Both Sexes"
focuses on the potential victim, a heroine of all the modern virtues vulnerable through her social status and her occupation as servant of the libertine who falls in love with her. Eventually, she
shows the power to reform her antagonist.[citation needed]

Male heroes adopted the new sentimental character traits in the 1760s. Laurence Sterne's Yorick, the hero of the Sentimental Journey (1768) did so with an enormous amount of humour. Oliver Goldsmith's
Vicar of Wakefield (1766) and Henry Mackenzie's Man of Feeling (1771) produced the far more serious role models.[citation needed]

The virtuous production inspired a sub- and counterculture of pornographic novels. Greek and Latin authors in modern translations had provided elegant transgressions on the market of the belles
lettres for the last century.[49] Satirical novels like Richard Head's English Rogue (1665) had led their heroes through urban brothels, women authors like Aphra Behn had offered their heroines
alternative careers as precursors of the 19th-century femmes fatales – without creating a subculture.[note 8] The market for belles lettres had been openly transgressive as long as it did not find any
reflections in other media. The new production beginning with works like John Cleland's Fanny Hill (1748) differed in that it offered almost exact reversals of the plot lines the virtuous production
demanded. Fanny Hill is introduced to a life of prostitution, learns to enjoy her part and establishes herself as a free and economically independent individual, in editions one could only expect to
buy under the counter.[50]

Openly uncontrollable conflicts arrived in the 1770s with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774). The titular hero realised how impossible it had become for him to integrate
into the new conformist society. Pierre Choderlos de Laclos's Les Liaisons dangereuses (1782) shows the other extreme, with a group of aristocrats playing games of intrigue and amorality.[citation

The social context of the 18th century novel
--------------------------------------------
- Changing cultural status
By around 1700, fiction was no longer a predominantly aristocratic entertainment, and printed books had soon gained the power to reach readers of almost all classes, though the reading habits differed
and to follow fashions remained a privilege. Spain was a trendsetter into the 1630s but French authors superseded Cervantes, de Quevedo, and Aleman in the 1640s. As Huet was to note in 1670, the
change was one of manners.[note 9] The new French works taught a new, on the surface freer, gallant exchange between the sexes as the essence of life at the French court.

The situation changed again from 1660s into the 1690s when works by French authors were published in Holland out of the reach of French censors.[51] Dutch publishing houses pirated of fashionable
books from France and created a new market of political and scandalous fiction. This led to a market of European rather than French fashions in the early 18th century.[52]

By the 1680s fashionable political European novels had inspired a second wave of private scandalous publications and generated new productions of local importance. Women authors reported on politics
and on their private love affairs in The Hague and in London. German students imitated them to boast of their private amours in fiction.[53] The London, the anonymous international market of the
Netherlands, publishers in Hamburg and Leipzig generated new public spheres.[note 10] Once private individuals, such as students in university towns and daughters of London's upper class began write
novels based on questionable reputations, the public began to call for a reformation of manners. [note 11]

Reform became the main goal of the second generation of 18th-century novelists who, by the mid-century, openly welcomed the change of climate that had first been promoted in journals such as The
Spectator. The Spectator Number 10 had stated that the aim was now "to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality […] to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries, schools and
colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffeehouses"). Constructive criticism of novels had until then been rare.[note 12] The first treatise on the history of the novel was a
preface to Marie de La Fayette's novel Zayde (1670).

New journals like The Spectator and The Tatler at the beginning of the century had reviews of novels. New "literary journals" like Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's Briefe, die neuste Literatur betreffend
(1758) appeared in the middle of the century with reviews of art and fiction. By the 1780s reviews played had an important role in introducing new works of fiction to the public. A later development
was the introduction of novels into school curricula and later that of universities.

- The acceptance of novels as literature
The French churchman and scholar Pierre Daniel Huet's Traitte de l'origine des romans (1670) laid the ground for a greater acceptance of the novel as literature in the early 18th century. The
theologian had not only dared to praise fictions, but he had also explained techniques of theological reading, for the interpretation of fiction, which was a novelty: an individual could read novels
and romances to gain insight into foreign and distant cultures as well as into his or her own culture.[note 13] He noted that Christ had used parables to teach.[54]

The decades around 1700 saw the appearance of new editions of Petronius, Lucian, and Heliodorus of Emesa.[note 14] The publishers equipped them with prefaces that referred to Huet's treatise.[note 15]
and the canon it had established. Exotic fictions entered the market that gave insight into the Islamic mind. Furthermore, The Book of One Thousand and One Nights was first published in Europe from
1704 to 1715 in French, and then translated immediately into English and German, and was seen as a contribution to Huet's history of romances.[note 16]

New classics were added to the market and the English, Select Collection of Novels in six volumes (1720–22), is a milestone in this development. It included Huet's Treatise, along with the European
tradition of the modern novel of the day: that is, novella from Machiavelli's to Marie de La Fayette's masterpieces. Aphra Behn's prose fictions had appeared as "novels" in the 1680s but when
reprinted in collections, her works became classics. Fenelon's Telemachus (1699/1700) became a classic within three years after its publication. New authors now entered the market ready to use their
own personal names as authors of fiction. Eliza Haywood followed the footsteps of Aphra Behn when, in 1719, she used her name with unprecedented pride.

19th century novel
==================

Romanticism
-----------
The very word romanticism is connected to the idea of romance, and the romance genre experienced a revival, at the end of the 18th century, with gothic fiction. The origin of the gothic romance is
attributed to English author Horace Walpole, with his 1764 novel The Castle of Otranto, subtitled (in its second edition) "A Gothic Story". Other important works are Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of
Udolpho (1794) and 'Monk' Lewis's The Monk (1795).

The new romances challenged the idea that the novel involved a realistic depictions of life, and destabilized the difference the critics had been trying to establish, between serious classical art and
popular fiction. Gothic romances exploited the grotesque,[55] and some critics thought that their subject matter deserved less credit than the worst medieval tales of Arthurian knighthood, and that if
the Amadis had troubled Don Quixote with curious fantasies, the new romantic tales were worse: they described a nightmare world, and explored sexual fantasies.[56]

The authors of this new type of fiction could be (and were) accused of exploiting all available topics to thrill, arouse, or horrify their audience. These new romantic novelists, at the same time,
claimed to explore the entire realm of fictionality. New, psychological interpreters, in the early 19th century, read these works as encounters with the deeper hidden truth of the human imagination:
this included sexuality, anxieties, and insatiable desires. Under such psychological readings, novels were described as exploring deeper human motives, and it was suggested that such artistic freedom
would reveal what had not previously been openly visible.

The romances of de Sade, Les 120 Journees de Sodome (1785), Poe's Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque (1840), Mary Shelley, Frankenstein (1818), and E. T. A. Hoffmann, Die Elixiere des Teufels
(1815), would later attract 20th-century psychoanalysts and supply the images for 20th- and 21st-century horror films, love romances, fantasy novels, role-playing computer games, and the surrealists.

The ancient romancers most commonly wrote fiction about the remote past with little attention to historical reality. Walter Scott's historical novel Waverley (1814) broke with this earlier tradition
of historical romance, and he was "the inventor of the true historical novel".[57] At the same time he was a romantic and was influenced by gothic romance. He had collaborated "with the most famous of
the Gothic novelists 'Monk' Lewis" on Tales of Wonder in 1801.[58] With his Waverley novels Scott "hoped to do for the Scottish border" what Goethe and other German poets "had done for the Middle
Ages, "and make its past live again in modern romance".[59] Scott's novels "are in the mode he himself defined as romance, 'the interest of which turns upon marvelous and uncommon incidents'".[60] He
used his imagination to re-evaluate history by rendering things, incidents and protagonists in the way only the novelist could do. His work remained historical fiction, yet it questioned existing
historical perceptions. The use of historical research was an important tool: Scott, the novelist, resorted to documentary sources as any historian would have done, but as a romantic artist he gave
his subject a deeper imaginative and emotional significance.[60] By combining research with "marvelous and uncommon incidents", Scott attracted a far wider market than any historian could, and he
became the most famous novelist of his generation, throughout Europe.[61]

The Victorian period: 1837-1901
-------------------------------
In the 19th century the relationship between authors, publishers, and readers, changed. Most of the early 18th century fiction had published anonymously. Authors had offered their manuscripts and
received all the payment to be expected for the manuscript. The new copyright laws introduced in the 18th and 19th centuries[62][note 19] promised royalties on all future editions. Another change in
the 19th century was that novelists began to read their works in theatres, halls, and book shops.[63]

Fiction was altered by these changes, including the creation of more difficult works. New novels also openly addressed current political and social issues, which were being discussed in newspapers and
magazines. The idea of responsibility became a key issue, whether of the citizen, or of the artist. The theoretical debate concentrated on questions around the moral soundness of the modern novel,[64]
on the integrity of individual artists, as well as the claims of aesthetes like as Oscar Wilde and Algernon Charles Swinburne, who proposed the idea of "art for art's sake".[65]

In this period the market for popular fiction grew, and competed with works of literature. Also in the 19th-century new institutions like the circulating library create a new market, and a new mass
reading public developed.[66]

Also during the 19th century major British writers such as Charles Dickens[67] and Thomas Hardy [68] were influenced by the romance genre tradition of the novel. The Bronte sisters were notable
mid-19th-century creators in this tradition, with Anne Bronte's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre and Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights.[69] Publishing at the very end of the
19th century, Joseph Conrad has been called, "a supreme 'romancer'".[70] In America "the romance ... proved to be a serious, flexible, and successful medium for the exploration of philosophical ideas
and attitudes", and notable examples include Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, and Herman Melville's Moby-Dick.[47]

A number of European novelists were influenced, during this period, by the earlier Romantic Movement, including Victor Hugo, with novels like The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (1831) and Les Miserables
(1862), and Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov's, A Hero of Our Time (1840).

Many 19th century authors dealt with significant social matters.[71] Emile Zola's novels depicted the world of the working classes, which Marx and Engels's non-fictional explores. In the United States
slavery and racism became topics of far broader public debate thanks to Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), which dramatises topics that had previously been discussed mainly in the
abstract. Charles Dickens' novels led his readers into contemporary workhouses, and provided first hand accounts of child labour. The treatment of the subject of war changed with Leo Tolstoy's War and
Peace (1868/69), where he questions the facts provided by historians. Similarly the treatment of crime is very different in Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment (1866), where the point of view is
that of a criminal. Women authors had dominated fiction from the 1640s into the early 18th century, but few before George Eliot so openly questioned the role, education, and status of women in
society, as she did.

As the novel became a platform of modern debate, national literatures were developed, that link the present with the past in the form of the historical novel. Alessandro Manzoni's I Promessi Sposi
(1827) did this for Italy, while novelists in Russia and the surrounding Slavonic countries, as well as Scandinavia, did likewise.

Along with this new appreciation of history, the future also became a topic for fiction. This had been done earlier in works like Samuel Madden's Memoirs of the Twentieth Century (1733) and Mary
Shelley's The Last Man (1826), a work whose plot culminated in the catastrophic last days of a mankind extinguished by the plague. Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward (1887) and H. G. Wells's The Time
Machine (1895) were concerned with technological and biological developments. Industrialization, Darwin's theory of evolution and Marx's theory of class divisions shaped these works and turned
historical processes into a subject matter of wide debate. Bellamy's Looking Backward became the second best-selling book of the 19th century after Harriet Beecher-Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin.[72][note
20] Such works led to the development of a whole genre of popular science fiction as the 20th century approached.

The 20th century and later
==========================

Modernism and post-modernism
----------------------------
James Joyce's Ulysses (1922) had a major influence on modern novelists, in the way that it replaced the 18th- and 19th-century narrator with a text that attempted to record inner thoughts: a "stream
of consciousness". This term was first used by William James in1890 and is used (or the related interior monologue) by modernists like Dorothy Richardson, Marcel Proust, as well as, later Virginia
Woolf and William Faulkner.[73] Also in the 1920s expressionist Alfred Doblin went in a different direction with Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929), where interspersed non-fictional text fragments exist
alongside the fictional material to create another new form of realism, which differs from that of stream-of-consciousness.

Later works like Samuel Beckett's trilogy Molloy (1951), Malone Dies (1951) and The Unnamable (1953), as well as Julio Cortazar's Rayuela (1963) and Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow (1973) all make
use of the stream-of-consciousness technique. On the other hand, Robert Coover is an example of those authors, who the 1960s, fragmented their stories and challenged time and sequentiality as
fundamental structural concepts.

The 20th century novels deals with a wide range of subject matter. Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front (1928) focusses on young German's experiences of World War I (and the more
existentialist Thor Goote created as a national socialist alternative). The Jazz Age is explored by American F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the Great Depression by fellow American John Steinbeck. The rise
of totalitarian states is the subject of British writer George Orwell. France's existentialism is the subject of French writers Jean-Paul Sartre's Nausea (1938) and Albert Camus' The Stranger (1942).
The counterculture of the 1960s led to revived interest in Hermann Hesse's Steppenwolf (1927), and produced such iconic works of its own like Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Thomas
Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow. Chuck Palahniuk's Fight Club (1996) (with the help of the film adaptation) is a male response to feminist politics. Virginia Woolf, Simone de Beauvoir, Doris Lessing,
Elfriede Jelinek were feminist voices during this period. Novelist have also been interested in the subject of racial and gender identity in recent decades.[74]

Furthermore, the major political and military confrontations of the 20th and 21st centuries have also influenced novelists. The events of World War II, from a German perspective, are dealt with by
Gunter Grass' The Tin Drum (1959) and an American by Joseph Heller's Catch-22 (1961). The subsequent Cold War influenced popular spy novels. Latin American self-awareness in the wake of the (failing)
left revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s resulted in a "Latin American Boom", linked to with the names of novelists Julio Cortazar, Mario Vargas Llosa, Carlos Fuentes and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, along
with the invention of a special brand of postmodern magic realism. .

Another major 20th-century social events, the so-called sexual revolution is reflected in the modern novel.[note 21] D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover had to be published in Italy in 1928;
British censorship lifted its ban as late as 1960. Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer (1934) created the comparable US scandal. Transgressive fiction from Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita (1955) to Michel
Houellebecq's Les Particules elementaires (1998) entered a literary field that eventually led to more pornographic works such as Anne Desclos' Story of O (1954) to Anais Nin's Delta of Venus (1978).

In the second half of the 20th century, Postmodern authors subverted serious debate with playfulness, claiming that art could never be original, that it always plays with existing materials.[75] The
idea that language is self-referential was already an accepted truth in the world of pulp fiction. A postmodernist re-reads popular literature as an essential cultural production. Novels from Thomas
Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49 (1966), to Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose (1980) and Foucault's Pendulum (1989) made use of intertextual references[76][77]

Genre fiction
-------------
The historic advantage of genres is to allow the direct marketing of fiction. While the reader of so-called elitist literature will follow public discussions of novels, the popular production has to
employ the traditionally more direct and short-term marketing strategies with the open declarations of their content. The most popular novels are based entirely on the expectations for the particular
genre, and this includes the creation of a series of novels with an identifiable brand name. i.e. the Sherlock Holmes series by Arthur Conan Doyle

Popular literature holds the largest market share. Romance fiction had an estimated $1.375 billion share in the US book market in 2007. Inspirational literature/religious literature followed with $819
million, science fiction/fantasy with $700 million, mystery with $650 million and then classic literary fiction with $466 million.[78]

Popular literature might be seen as the successor of the early modern chapbook. Both fields share a focus on readers who are in search of accessible reading satisfaction.<[79] The 20th-century love
romance is a successor of the novels Madeleine de Scudery, Marie de La Fayette, Aphra Behn, and Eliza Haywood wrote from the 1640s into the 1740s. The modern adventure novel goes back to Daniel
Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719) and its immediate successors. Modern pornography has no precedent in the chapbook market but originates in libertine and hedonistic belles lettres, of works likeJohn
Cleland's Fanny Hill (1749) and similar eighteenth century novels. Ian Fleming's James Bond is a descendant of the anonymous yet extremely sophisticated and stylish narrator who mixed his love affairs
with his political missions in La Guerre d'Espagne (1707). Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon is influenced by Tolkien, as well as Arthurian literature, including its 19th-century successors.
Modern horror fiction also has no precedent on the market of chapbooks but goes back to the elitist market of early-19th-century Romantic literature. Modern popular science fiction has an even shorter
history, from the 1860s.

The authors of popular fiction tend to proclaim that they have exploited the controversial topics – and that is the essential difference between them and so-called elitist literature. Dan Brown does
this by discussing on his website the question whether his Da Vinci Code is an anti-Christian novel.[80]

The author of popular fiction has a fan community to serve, so that she or he can risk rebuffing the literary critic. However, the artificial boundaries between popular and serious literature have
blurred in recent years, through the explorations of postmodern and poststructuralist writers, as well as by adaptation of popular literary classics by the film industry.

Crime became a major subject of 20th and 21st century genre novelists and Crime fiction reflects the realities of modern industrialized societies. Crime is personal and public subject: criminals each
have their personal motivations; detectives, see their moral codes challenged. Patricia Highsmith's thrillers became a medium of new psychological explorations. Paul Auster's New York Trilogy
(1985–1986) is an example of experimental postmodernist literature.

Fantasy has become a major area of commercial fiction. A major example is J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings (1954/55), a work that mutated from a book written for young readers in search of
openly fictionalised role models into a major cultural artefact. Tolkien successfully revived European epic literature from Beowulf and the North Germanic Edda as well as the Arthurian Cycles.
 
Science fiction has developed a variety of genres from the early, technological adventure Jules Verne had made fashionable in the 1860s. Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932) has become a focus for
debate about Western consumerism and technology. George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) deals with totalitarianism and surveillance, among other matters. Stanislaw Lem, Isaac Asimov and Arthur C.
Clarke produced modern classics which focus on the interaction between humans and machines. A new wave of authors explore post-apocalyptic fantasies and virtual reality. William Gibson's Neuromancer
(1984) became a cult classic and founded cyberpunk science fiction.
